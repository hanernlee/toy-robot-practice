##The Toy Robot Simulator

##About


##Specifications

The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop of dimension 5 x 5 units with no other obstructions on the table surface.

The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table with the exception that it does not fall off the table. Any movement that would result in the robot falling off from the table must be prevented, however further valid commands must still be allowed.
